# RSA Factoring Challenge by ALX
This project was done for tackling on the ALX RSA Factoring Challenge.

## About Project
In this project, I'm faced with two tasks. 

First task (task 0) involves me factorizing as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

Second task (task 1) a semiprime number that I must attempt to factorize into its prime components.

These challenges are not just about solving problems; they are opportunities to enhance my skills in number theory and cryptography. Learnt about how there different algorithms to factors different range of numbers.
